    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>1. Spirited Away</h3>
    <p><strong>Why I love it:</strong> This is my favorite anime. I love the beautiful imagery and storytelling.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Transformers: One</h3>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> A recently released movie that was somewhat mediocre, but still fun to watch!</p>

    <h3>3. The Prime Death</h3>
    <p><strong>Just for fun:</strong> A fictional entry to complete my top 3. The concept is thrilling!</p>
